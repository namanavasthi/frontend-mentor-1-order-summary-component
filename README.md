# Frontend Mentor: #1 Order Summary Component

okay, so frontend mentor wants me to post a readme in a particular format, being the rebel I am, I'd gladly not comply to that request.
I really want to only focus on coding these things out as fast as I humanly can and not deal into documentation related specifics.

As my [bootstrap repo](https://github.com/namanavasthi/frontend-mentor-bootstrap) already mentions any tech stack related information necessary.

## Thoughts

- as i'm building this thing up, i'd probably focus more on the mobile comps first and then move over to desktop. I just prefer it that way.
- once im done with base level layout-ing of components and how those components would be arranged, i'd move onto any tailwind related changes needed
- after that comes interactions (click)
  > NOTE : if not explicitly mentioned, I WOULD NOT worry about accessibility.
- since im using tailwind defaults, i'd try to bring it as close as i can to the original without actually measuring things around
  > NOTE : look! this isnt TS, i want to get done with these REAL quick, don't have the time to satisfy tailwind's absurd ts needs
